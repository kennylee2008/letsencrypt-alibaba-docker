# letsencrypt-alibaba-docker
The docker image for letsencrypt-alibaba repository.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/) can issue a certificate for your websiteâ€™s domain. 

If you wish to generate a wildcard certificate, Let's Encrypt will ask you to configure a special subdomain under your domain name and set it to a TXT type value for Let's Encrypt to determine that you do have the rights to use the domain. For example, generate a certificate for the domain *.example.com so that you can use the same certificate and support many subdomains, which is very useful in some business scenarios.

By default, you need to log in to your domain name service provider and set the value of the specified subdomain of type TXT as required and wait for an undetermined length of time before proceeding to the next step. Otherwise, you are most likely to face a failure. This library encapsulates the entire authentication process, including setting the specified value to your domain name service provider, automatically determining whether the set value has taken effect and triggering Let's Encrypt's challenge authentication, automatically registering users, etc.

## 3. Get the certificate file

After you run the task sucessfully, you will get two files in the _certificate_ directory: 

- _domain-chain.crt_
The certificate issued by Let's Encrypt.

- _domain.key_
You domain private key.

## 4. A sample config in Nginx 

```

server {
    listen      80;
    server_name futlabs.com www.futlabs.com subdomain.futlabs.com;
    return       301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name futlabs.com www.futlabs.com subdomain.futlabs.com;

    client_max_body_size 5M;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/futlabs.com/domain-chain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/futlabs.com/domain.key;

    root /var/www/html;
}

```
